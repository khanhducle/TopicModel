# Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Topic Model using Gibbs Sampling
Use a Brown corpus to explore hidden topics for each document in the corpus

## Implementation and Visualization
Look at "LDA_Gibbs.ipynb" for the implementation and visualization of the algorithm. 

Other notebooks are just for comparision purpose

## Explored topics

* topic 0 :af, temperature, surface, pressure, anode, atom, type, data, material, particle, cell, measurement, reaction, rate, effect, energy, activity, artery, small, radiation,
